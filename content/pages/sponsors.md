Title: Sponsors
Author: Paul Brabban

Sheffield ML doesn't have any sponsors yet for 2018.
Sponsor us today to get your name or logo on our homepage and info of your choosing on this page.
You'll also get a thank you in every Sheffield ML session you support,
with the option of supplying your own slide for our intro deck.

Do something amazing and get your brand in front of Machine Learning enthusiasts right here in Sheffield!

## Venues

Our biggest necessary cost is a venue every month.
We'd really like a sponsor who can help us book a venue in 6-12 month blocks
to make things consistent for attendees and easy for organisers.

## Other things a sponsor could help with include:

* Speaker travel costs (variable)
* Infrastructure (around $9.99/month for meetup.com)
* In-Session Refreshments (open to suggestions!)
* Competition prizes (open to suggestions!)

We're also open to other suggestions!
Talk to us about sponsoring via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shef_ml)
