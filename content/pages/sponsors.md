Title: Sponsors
Author: Paul Brabban

Sheffield ML doesn't have any sponsors yet for 2018.
Sponsor us today to get your name or logo on our homepage and info of your choosing on this page.
You'll also get a thank you in every Sheffield ML session you support,
with the option of supplying your own slide for our intro deck.


The kinds of things a sponsor could help with include:

* Venues
* Speaker travel costs
* Our domain name
* Refreshments
* Competition prizes

We're also open to other support suggestions!
Talk to us about sponsoring via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shef_ml) or email
