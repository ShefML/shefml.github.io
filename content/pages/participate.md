Title: Participate

## [Attendees](#attendees)

We're a small, friendly group of people learning about machine learning together.
We have a mix of experience, beginners and experts alike are welcome.
Sessions will last two to three hours, and we aim to have some hands-on element in all our sessions.
You learn best by doing, after all!
It's fine if you're late, or you have to leave early.

## [Speakers](#speakers)

We love to hear about real-life machine learning!
You don't have to be an expert to have something interesting to say.
Speaking doesn't have to be about talking in front of slides for an hour, either.
You could do a "lightning talk" where you might only speak for 10-20 minutes.

You might even run a workshop session - maybe you found a great Kaggle competition and you don't know where to start.
Great! Come along and explain the competition and why you want to take it on, and we'll tackle it together!

If you've not been a speaker before, it's nothing to worry about.
We'll help you prepare and you'll have a great time!
